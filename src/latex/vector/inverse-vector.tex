\subsubsection{Inverse vector}

Each vector $\vec{\Green v}$ has an inverse vector $-\vec{\Green v}$

\begin{tikzpicture}
    \draw [gray, very thin] (-0.4, -0.4) grid (3.4, 1.4);

    \draw node [vertex] (1) at (0, 0) {};
    \draw node [vertex] (2) at (3, 1) {};

    \draw [thick, cyan, ->] (2) -- (1);
\end{tikzpicture}
