# Component, Instance & Element

<!--

	\text{Component}: Data \to Element \to UI
$$

*Component* is a reusable piece of UI code. It can be a class or a function. *Instance* is what is referred to `this` in class-components. Function-components do not have instances

*Element* is a plain object that describes UI. It's created using `React.createElement`, `React.createFactory` or via `JSX` in general
