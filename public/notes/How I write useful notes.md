# How I write useful notes

It's very important to extract valuable pieces from the flow of information around us.
I&nbsp;follow this approximate algorithm:

**Step 0**, which does not really imply any actions: _Populating inbox._
In order to make a note, the information should be found first.
It is important to control the sources of such information

- Active searching: Youtube, Feedly, books
- Passive searching: podcasts, talks with coworkers, just thoughts that occasionally come to mind, saved messages in Telegram

**Step 1**: _Importance assessment_.
This point is :mark[critical]{color=red} because it prevents from information overflow.
Ask yourself these questions:

- Is that information _important_ for me somehow?
- Can I apply this knowledge in _real world_, in _real projects?_

It is possible that during this step I realize that this information is not really important for me despite its popularity.
That means it's not necessary to summarize it, and I could just keep a link to that or even remove it completely

Of course sometimes important information could become unimportant and vice versa. It's normal and there is no need to worry about that

**Step 3:** _Understanding & Rethinking_

I don't start writing notes _until_ I've understood what I've read.
I ask myself the following questions:

- Have I read the article or the book _to the end?_
- Is there a _valuable or new_ information for me?
- Did I _understood_ what I've read?

Information may be important for me but I may not be able to understand it, for example I may not have enough knowledge to comprehend it.
In this case I should either come back to it later or learn something that will help me to better understand it now

Then, if everything is clear, I do the following:

- Formulate **the name** for the note
- Formulate **the idea** in two-three sentences

This will serve as a note draft.
Sometimes it's enough for the entire note, for example: [[Multiplexing]]

**Step 3:** _Summarizing & Simplifying_

I try to use tools, that simplify the summary and avoid using complicated words and phrases. Following questions are helpful:

- Can I _visualize_ this information? And should I?
  - Can I add _interactivity_? And should I?
- Do I use _complicated sentences_? Can I get rid of them?
  - Do I use _long or complicated words?_
  - Do I use _long paragraphs?_
  - Do I use _too many numbers?_
  - Do I use _extra details and unnecessary clarifications?_
  - Do I use _lists where I could go with paragraphs?_

**Step 4:** _Comparing several sources of information_

Then I look for other sources of information on the topic to compare the same from several sides

Here it is, the note is done
