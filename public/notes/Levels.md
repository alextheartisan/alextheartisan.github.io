# Levels

Levels help to *measure the maturity* of:
- employee (Personal level)
- team (Team level)
- group of employees (Group level)
- company (Company level)

The difference of levels inside the organization should be minimal

### Examples

 Let's take an employee of a L3. It would be easier for them to work with L2 and L4, than with L1 and L5
