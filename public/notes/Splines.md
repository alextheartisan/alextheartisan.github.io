# Splines

**Spline** is a curve defined by a special function using *control points*. 

$$
	Control \ points \xrightarrow{} Curve
$$

When a curve passes through all control poiints it is called *interpolating curve*. When it passes near to the control points then it's called *approximating curve*

## Degrees

- Constant (degree of 0): a point or *a constant*, defined by 1 point
- LIne (degree of 1): a line or *linear curve*, defined by 2 points
- Quadratic curve (degree of 2): a parabola or *quadratic curve*, defined by 3 points 
- Cubic curve (degree of 3): *cubic curve*, defined by 4 points
