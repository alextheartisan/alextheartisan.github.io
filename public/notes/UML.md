# UML

Unified Modelling Language is used for visualization diagrams

## Relations

Solid line indicates an _association_. `Bottle` knows about `Fluid`, but `Fluid` doesn't know about `Bottle`

<!-- ![tex](tex-images/uml-association.svg) -->

_Dependency_ is weaker than an _association_

<!-- ![tex](tex-images/uml-dependency.svg) -->

_Composition_ is a strong _Whole-Part relationship_. When the whole is destroyed, parts are destroyed too

<!-- ![tex](tex-images/uml-composition.svg) -->

_Aggregation_ represents a _Container-Contained_ relationship
