# UML

::aliases[Unified Modelling Language]

## Association

A solid line indicates an _association_

![tex](tex-images/uml-association.svg)

**Bottle** knows about **Fluid**, but **Fluid** doesn't know about **Bottle**

## Dependency

A dependency is weaker than an _association_

![tex](tex-images/uml-dependency.svg)

## Composition

A composition is a strong _Whole-Part relationship_. When the whole is destroyed, parts are destroyed too

![tex](tex-images/uml-composition.svg)

## Aggregation

Aggregation represents a _Container-Contained_ relationship

![tex](tex-images/uml-aggregation.svg)
