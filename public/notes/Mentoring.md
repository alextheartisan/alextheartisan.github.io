# Mentoring

## First questions

- Where are you now?  
- Where do you want to be?

## Apply Bottom-Up & Top-Down approaches in studying  

- Sometimes it’s good to start from theory, sometimes it’s good to start from making things at now  
- Practical things first, theoretical things last  
- How can I use this knowledge right now?

## If some topic is not clear switch to something else and return back in a week/month  

- I don’t understand it now but I will later  
- Sometimes it becomes clearer on the next day (because the brain works on it at night)

## Set realistic goals

- Good goal: Receive a job offer
- Bad goal: Learn a language

## Don’t try to eat the elephant as a whole  

- Learn one thing at a time and connect recieved knowledge to already known pieces of information

## Be wary of _Collector’s Fallacy problem_

- Why can’t I hold all these spells bookmarks?

## Be wary of _Impostor syndrome_

- The deeper you go, the less you know  
	- I know that I know nothing  
	- It’s much easier in the beginning because you know what to do  
	- Majority of all tutorials are for beginners, some of them for advanced level, very few for experts  
- Compete with yourself, not with others  
- Every beginner is equally weak, every senior is differently strong  
	- Everyone has their own path, their own mental model, and sees the world their own way  
- Danning-Kruger effect
