## Sources of light

### Point light

::aliases[Omnidirectional]

Radiates light _equally in all directions from a fixed position_ in 3D space. They have an intensity

Examples: a light blub or a candle.

### Directional light

Directional lights have a _fixed direction_ and intensity

Examples: sunlight

### Ambient light

Ambient light _has only intensity_ and applies to every object. Thus it's enough to have a single ambient light on the scene

- Global illumination

## [[Reflection (CG)|Reflection]]

- [[Shadows]]

* Direct Lighting / Indirect Lighting
* Light Baking = Light Mapping = Static Lighting, предварительный Raytracing
