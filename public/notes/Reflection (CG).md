# Reflection (CG)

There are two kinds of objects, from the perspective of reflecting light: *matte* and *shiny*

### Diffuse reflection

Most objects are *matte*. Lighting rays hitting these objects *scatter back in every direction*. The amount of light reflected *does depend on the angle* between the ray and the surface.

### Specular reflection

*Shiny* objects look slightly different depending on the *where they're viewed from*. The way you perceive the surface of these objects *does depend on your point of view*
