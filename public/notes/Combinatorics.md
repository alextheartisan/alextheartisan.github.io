# Combinatorics

The main question of combinatorics is "How many?" and the main task is counting the length of resulting set of elements

- Ordered group of elements is called *tuple*, denoted as  $(1, 2, 3)$
- Unordered group of elements is called [[Set theory|Set]], denoted as  $\{1, 2, 3\}$

<!-- $n$ is a total number of objects in a set $S$. $k$ is a number of objects taken -->

## Types of selection

- [[Combinations]]
- [[Permutations]]

## Rules

- Rules of sum
- Rules of product
