# Package by feature not layer

One of the most sacred knowledge I obtained in my first year on the job. Every tutorial back then used file structure that contained directories `html`, `css` and `js` (with variations like `styles` and `scripts`) thus having a _layer-as-first-level_ architecture. This is also the structure that most modern frameworks offer by default

First I discovered this article: ["Package by feature, not layer"](http://www.javapractices.com/topic/TopicAction.do?Id=205), and that was my first insight of _module-as-first-level_ architecture

<!-- In short it implies that **it is better to package by feature and not layer** -->

Funnily enough nowadays everybody learned to modularize React components (e. g. keep together `html`, `js` (in form of `jsx`) and `css`), but they still create directories like `reducers`, `actions`, etc...

<!-- Some people think that this approach is a violation of a separation of concern while it's not -->

All the above is especially true for applicaitons of medium (10k-100k LOC) and high (100k+ LOC) complexity

This is one of the most important architectural patterns

<!-- TODO: add frontend approach -->
