# Files

There are _directories_, _common files_ and _executable files_

Files have 3 types of operations: _reading_ (`r`), _writing_ (`w`) and _executing_ (`x`). For directories executing means permission to enter it and search its files


File descriptors are used to keep track of files opened by the process.
There are 3 standard file descriptors: `stdin`, `stdout` and `stderr`

Directories are the way of grouping files

Special files can be used as the *interface* in a form of file
