# Hi

I'm Alex

This is my _"second brain"_ where I write about things that are interesting to me. Many of these things are related to software development, especially the visible side of it, GUI and graphics

[[My resume]]

If it's your first time here, then you might find helpful getting familiar
with [[The way I write these notes]] to understand why some of them look as
they look

All the notes are divided into several sections:

- [[Learning]]
- [[Linear algebra]]
- [[Algorithms & Data Structures]]
- [[Software Architecture]]
- [[Frontend]]
- [[Java]]
- [[Data Access]]

<!--
- [[Knowledge]] & [[Guides]]
- [[Thoughts & Scratches]]
