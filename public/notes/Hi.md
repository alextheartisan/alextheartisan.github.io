# Hi

I'm Alexey

This is my _"second brain"_ or _"digital garden"_ where I write about things that are interesting to me. Majority of these things relate to software development, mainly the visible side of it, GUI and graphics

If it's your first time here, then you might find helpful getting familiar
with [[The way I write these notes|the way I write these notes]] to understand why some of them look as
they look

Starting points to explore:

- [[Software]]
- [[UI Design]]
- [[Mathematics]]
- [[Learning & Note Taking]]

Here are some cool interactive widgets

- [[Bezier curves]]
- [[Backtracking search]]
