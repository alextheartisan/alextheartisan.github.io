Hello, Jasna
I'm available for the interview every weekday, at these time slots: 10:00, 12:00, 15:00, 17:00 (CET). So far none of them are busy, so choose one that is best for you.

Alexey is an excellent specialist, having both a sharp mind and great technical skills. He is also a proactive person, who knows the value of agile principles. Besides coding, he likes to take part in establishing and fine-graining the development process.



Hi, I write code professionally since 2014, mainly using JavaScript ecosystem. And currently I'm also studying Java in order to expand my CS knowledge and for a possibility to work with back-end in future (and this language is not necessary to be Java)

I worked with Alexey on the same team in Sberbank (The largest bank in Russia) on Domclick project. He is an excellent engineer, both having sharp mind and a lot of practical experience. I would recommend him for any project that requires deep understanding of Java ecosystem.

  

  

It was fantastic to work together with Yerzhan Tashbenbetov, He was an exceptional CTO who contributed significantly to the success of the company. I would recommend him to any project that requires the very best in development execution and tech leadership skills.

  

Yerzhan is a passionate developer, he knows a lot about React, React native and plain Javascript, it was a pleasure to work with him

  

Yerzhan is awesome! He is an ideal colleague. Professionalism, diligence, energy, intelligence and a charming smile create the image of a real leader and the best developer I've ever worked with.
