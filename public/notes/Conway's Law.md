# Conway's Law


*Any organization that designs a system (defined broadly) will produce a design whose structure is a copy of the organization's communication structure*


Conway's Law, coined in 1967 by programmer Melvin Conway, states that **organizations create systems that mirror their internal communications structures**. That is, the system is isomorphic to the conditions of its creation.
