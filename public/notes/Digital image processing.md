# Digital image processing

**DIP** is a manipulation of digital images, processing them through an algorithm. Various applications include: motion detection, face tracking

First [[Sampling]], then [[Quantization]]

- Normalizing photometric properties of the image, such as brightness or color
- Cropping the bounds of the image, such as centering an object in a photograph
- Removing digital noise from an image, such as digital artifacts from low light levels
