# Top-down & bottom-up learning approaches

## Top-down

- Practical knowledge first: tutorials, "How-To" guides, `jQuery` before JavaScript
- Then you move back to the theory

## Bottom-up

- 10000 hours of theory
- Then you write your first line of code

Both approaches has its own advantages and downsides
