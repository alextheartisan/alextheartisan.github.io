# Tips for beginner programmers

## Start with two questions

_Where am I now?_ What is your background? What do you already know? What is you starting point? Do you have any fellow programmers?

_Where do I want to be?_ What do you want to do? Frontend/Backend? Mobile development? Maybe, you don't even know yet?

## Describe and set a _realistic goal_

It should follow [SMART criteria](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SMART_criteria) (in short, be specific and measurable)

-   Bad examples: Learn a programming language. Become a programmer
-   Good examples: Find a job as a Junior Backend Developer, Build an application that will show currency ratios, Make "Tetris" game

## Start learning

Google and StackOverflow are your deities now, praise to them

Don’t try to eat the elephant as a whole. Learn one thing at a time and connect received knowledge to already known pieces of information

When learning, try to make interesting things, something that _you really like_ and want to do. This will feed your interest over time and will prevent you from dropping learning (which often happens)

If some topic is not clear switch to something else and return back in a week/month. Sometimes it becomes clearer on the next day (because the brain works on it at night)

> _"I don’t understand it now but I will later"_

Apply [[Top-down & bottom-up learning approaches]]

-   Sometimes it’s good to start from theory, sometimes it’s good to start from making things at now
-   Practical things first, theoretical things last
-   How can I use this knowledge right now?

Be wary of [collector's fallacy](https://zettelkasten.de/posts/collectors-fallacy/) and don't try to collect all these bookmarks about various tools

Be wary of _Impostor syndrome_

-   The deeper you go, the less you know
    -   _I know that I know nothing_
    -   It’s much easier in the beginning because you know what to do
    -   Majority of all tutorials are for beginners, some of them for advanced level, very few for experts
-   Compete with yourself, not with others
-   Every beginner is equally weak, every senior is differently strong
    -   Everyone has their own path, their own mental model, and sees the world their own way
-   Danning-Kruger effect

Start with _Python_ or _JavaScript_ depending on backend/frontend goals. Both are widely used, both are dynamically typed. Despite popular opinions, Java and C# are not easy-to-grasp languages and you can return back to them later after learning some basic concepts
