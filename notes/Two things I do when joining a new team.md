# Two things I do when joining a new team

When I join a team I have a goal to make the team as productive as possible. At first I pay attention to two things:

1. Team should be *as close as possible* in terms of their placement and connectivity. If it's an office work then they should sit near each other. Whether it's remote work they should have a common place to chat, both text and video
1. Team should set up an *effective feedback process*. It can be 1-on-1 meetings, weekly retrospectives or other forms

> Any other initiatives made before these two are ineffective, useless or even harmful
