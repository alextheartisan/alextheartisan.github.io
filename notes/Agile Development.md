# Agile Development

## Tasks

Tasks are concrete actions which can be performed straight away without further thinking and research. Tasks should meet these 4 criteria:

- Wording should sound like an answer on the question _"What should I do next?"_
- Wording should _start with a verb in the infinite form_
- Task should be accomplished by _minimum use of thinking_
- Task should represent an _first action_ towards the ultimate goal
- (Optional but useful) Task should be accomplished within _20-30 minutes_

Tasks should follow _proper wording templates_:

- _"Meet..."_
  - Reformulate as "Suggest Johnny to meet on Monday at 6:00 PM"
- _"Find out..."_
  - Ensure how to do that i.e. "Write to Johnny why this happened"
- _"Think of..."_
  - Formulate the first question about the problem you face. Once the question is clear it will be easier to create an action like "Write...", "Call...", "Write down...", "Calculate..."
- _"Find the time..."_
  - Open the calendar, find the firs empty slot, decide on the next action (make an appointment, schedule a call)
- _"Get the answer... / Wait for answer..."_
  - Reformulate as a concrete action: "Write a message..." , "make a call..."

Organizing _tasks by hierarchy is a bad choice_ as it's too complex

Organizing _tasks by priority is a bad choice_ as well as it involves additional thinking. The best priority system is to put important tasks higher in the list

## User stories

_User Stories_ are written using the following pattern: As a _X_ I can _Y_ so that _Z_

User stories should be estimated (not tasks)

Summary of various tasks:

|                 | Visible    | Invisible       |
| :-------------- | :--------- | :-------------- |
| **Planned**     | User story | Technical story |
| **Not planned** | Bug        | Technical debt  |

# Daily meetings

Good pattern is discussing tasks, bad is discussing what peaople are doing
