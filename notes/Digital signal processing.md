# Digital Signal Processing

::aliases[DSP]

**Signal** is the description of the *evolution of a physical phenomenon*. How to describe weather? Measure the temperature. How to describe a sound? Measure the pressure wave or a magnetic deviation. A black-white photograph is a light intensity of a gray levels on a paper

**Processing** is about *making the sense* of the signal information: *analyzing* or *synthesising* it

**Digital** means that the processed information is *discrete*, so it is easy to use computationally

<!-- Sampling Theorem -->

### Discretization

- [[Sampling]] is the discretization of time
- [[Quantization]] is the discretization of amplitude

## Transforms

- [[Z Transform]]
	- Inverse ZT
	- Properties of ZT
	- Region of convergence
- [[Discrete Fourier Transform]]
	- DTF properties
	- Discrete Time Fourier Transform (DTFT)
- [[Fast Fourier Transform]]


## Filters

- IIR filters
- Linear Phase FIR filters
- Optimum filters
- Impluse Response

- [[Convolution]]
- Correlation
