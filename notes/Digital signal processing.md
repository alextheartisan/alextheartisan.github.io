# Digital Signal Processing

**Signal** is the description of the *evolution of a physical phenomenon*. How to describe weather? Measure the temperature. How to describe a sound? Measure the pressure wave or a magnetic deviation. A black-white photograph is a light intensity of a gray levels on a paper

**Processing** is about *making the sense* of the signal information: *analyzing* or *synthesizing* it

**Digital** means that the processed information is *discrete*, so it is easy to use computationally

<!-- Sampling Theorem -->
