# Top-down & bottom-up learning approaches

Top-down is about practical knowledge here & now: tutorials, "How-To" guides, `jQuery` before JavaScript then you move back to the theory when you need to know how it works and how it's all connected

Bottom-up approach is: you study the theory for 10000 hours then you write your first line of code

Both approaches has its own advantages and downsides
