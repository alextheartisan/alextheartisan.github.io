# Histories

::aliases[Stories]

Histories are the _chains of [[Contexts|context]] changes_, their [[Streams (Management)|stream]] or their evolution

People are communicating using stories

Dynamic complexity forces us to think in terms of _stories_, that's where the scientific way is not working

Wardley maps

- A person's career is a story too
- History is not about the past, it's about _changes_

- _Strategy_ is a story about the future

### Notes

- _User stories_ from agile methodologies are related, we use them when we can't formalize things because of complexity
