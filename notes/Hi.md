# Hi

I'm Alexey

This is my _"second brain"_ or _"digital garden"_ where I write about things that are interesting to me. Many of these things are related to software development, especially the visible side of it, GUI and graphics

If it's your first time here, then you might find helpful getting familiar
with [[The way I write these notes|the way I write these notes]] to understand why some of them look as
they look

Here are some starting points to explore:

- [[Software]]
- [[UI Design]]
- [[Mathematics]]
- [[Learning & Note Taking]]
