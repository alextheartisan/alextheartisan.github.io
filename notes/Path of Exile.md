### Heist

Which Heists to do if you have limited time: Deception, Lockpicking, Demolition, Trap Disarmament. Deception is important because every time you do a contract with Gianna she gives you 1 blueprint reveal at a discount. At level 5 this is a fat discount, almost 50%, so you can run more blueprints without spending all your rogue markers. Lockpicking has currency rewards. Demolition has Delirium. Trap Disarmament has Breach and Legion.

Pay attention to contract rewards. Priceless contracts give you A LOT of rogue markers. Precious are also pretty good.

Open up the whole zone, fill your alert level up til it's almost ready to pop. Get as far from the end reward as you possibly can and still get there in time. Grab a chest to make the lockdown timer start and run to the end reward opening as many chests as possible along the way before lockdown actually begins.

You can hold Alt over blueprints and it shows you what rewards are in each blueprint.

Not every blueprint wing has a decent reward at the end. Feel free to ignore the bad ones in favor of opening more large/small chests during the lockdown timer.

- The best rogues are Vinderi (duplicates items), Gianna (discounts) and Karst (big alert timer reduction.)

End game blueprint running involves rolling rogue gear with as many "duplicates currency" mods as possible. You get this on brooches. Since you bring in 3 rogues per grand heist, and each one's duplication mods stack with each other, you end up with a really large chance to duplicate currency, especially if Vinderi is there.

To survive lockdown, I use dash+second wind to zoom zoom, void sphere in doorways so they can't zoom zoom, and CWDT+frost wall to buffer them from me.
