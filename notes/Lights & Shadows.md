# Lights & Shadows

## Sources of light

Point light, or Omnidirectional light, radiates light _equally in all directions from a fixed position_ in 3D space. They have an intensity. Examples: a light bulb or a candle.

Directional light has a _fixed direction_ and intensity. Examples: sunlight

Ambient light _has only intensity_ and applies to every object. Thus it's enough to have a single ambient light on the scene
