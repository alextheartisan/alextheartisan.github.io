# Three books for every developer

## Cracking the coding interview

The book about the importance of _hard-skills_. In some way this is a meta-book that leads to other technical and problem-solving books

## Project Phoenix

The book about the importance of _soft-skills_. Basically, the engineer's variant of the book "The Goal" by E. Goldratt

## Джедайские техники (Jedi techniques)

This book is in Russian, but it's basically a compilation of various techniques of _personal development_ (author says the same). It is based on the works of R. Canneman, T. Urban and many others
