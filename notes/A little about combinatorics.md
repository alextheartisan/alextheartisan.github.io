# A little about combinatorics

The main question of combinatorics is "How many?" and the main task is counting the length of resulting set of elements

- Ordered group of elements is called _tuple_ $(1, 2, 3)$
- Unordered group of elements is called [[Set theory|Set]] $\{1, 2, 3\}$

<!-- $n$ is a total number of objects in a set $S$. $k$ is a number of objects taken -->
